//"reduxForm" - allows component to communicate with the Redux-Form reducer, also adds loads of additonal properties that are passed to our component (e.g pulling off "handleSubmit"); form: 'PostsNewForm' - the name for this specific form (has to be a unique string, otherwise states from other forms with the same name will merge together), sometimes we might have multiple forms on the screen at the same time (e.g sign up and sign in) this helps to isolate different forms and their states; connect(null,{ createPost })(PostsNew) - wires up our new post action creator to our component
